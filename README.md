# Exploit-Development
A repository containing exploit programs and resources helping me learn the technique
In this repository I will be posting POCs of many exploits which I write myself (without looking at the original POCs) to learn and understand how low level exploits work

# Some areas of interests
1. Vanilla BoFs
2. SEH BoFs
3. Egg Hunting exploits
4. DEP Bypass
5. ASLR Bypass
6. Kernel Level exploits (*nix only)
7. maybe something more?

Don't be a script kiddie anymore!!!
